This project aims at using real time object detection as the primary means for automating the retail inventory management systems and also for detecting stock-out conditions on shelves. This project adopts an approach in which 24 hours video surveillance of the different aisles of the store continually keep a track of the number of each kind of product that is displayed on the shelves. Object detection is performed using Faster R-CNN. Using the data collected from object counting we perform inventory management in excel.
