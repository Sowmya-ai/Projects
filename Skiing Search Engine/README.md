# Skiing Search Engine

Welcome to the Skiing Search Engine repository!

## Overview

-In this project we've built a search engine from scratch for Skiing with over 100,000 crawled web pages which were then indexed. 
-We then ran 3 different relevance models namely Vector Space Relevance Model, PageRank and HITS. 
-This was followed by QE and Clustering steps. 
-In Clustering we implemented both Hierarchical and Flat Clustering. 
-Query Expansion based on Association, Metric and Scalar clusters were implemented

## Technologies used

- **Apache Nutch**: For web crawling and fetching skiing-related content.
- **Apache Solr**: For indexing and searching the crawled content.
- **Python**: For backend processing and integration with Apache Solr.
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: For the basic user interface.

1. Ensure Apache Nutch and Apache Solr are installed and configured properly.
2. Start the Apache Nutch crawler to crawl skiing-related websites and gather content.
3. Index the crawled content using Apache Solr.
4. Start the Solr server.
5. Run the Python backend code for processing and integration with Solr.
6. Open the provided user interface in a web browser.
