# Scene Recognition Using CNN Built From Scratch

## Overview

- In this project, we introduce an innovative method for scene recognition involving a custom-built CNN trained on a dataset containing images belonging to three distinct classes: buildings, forests, and mountains. 
- Our CNN comprises convolutional, max-pooling, and two fully connected layers. 
- Our method employs intricate convolutions for RGB image classification, and we utilize the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimization technique with mini batches.

## How to run

### Google Colab

- We recommend using Google Colab to run the project, as no explict package installation needs to be performed.
- In Google Colab, go to File > Upload Notebook and upload the submitted Scene_Recognition_CNN.ipynb notebook 
- Alternatively, you can visit this [Colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16Smb2P3OyIjQ_9u9oUGp3yiNQMT-gDDG?usp=sharing) and do File > Save a copy in Drive
- Run all the cells sequentially and observe model training and testing outputs in the console. 
- (Note) : It takes about 15 min to load the images, and around 1 hour 15 min to build the model.

### Local

- Install Python 3 and a suitable IDE like PyCharm
- Install packages - numpy, requests, torchvision, Pillow, tensorflow, matplotlib, sklearn, math
- Open the submitted Scene_Recognition_CNN.ipynb notebook in the IDE, and run the cells sequentially, or click 'Run All'
- (Note) : It takes about 15 min to load the images, and around 1 hour 15 min to build the model.
