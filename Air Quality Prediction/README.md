# Air Quality Prediction Using LSTM

## Overview

- The model developed in this project uses LSTM network trained with Back Propagation Through Time algorithm for predicting the air quality and prior to that we use exploratory data analysis methods to determine the essential features from the dataset obtained from .
- The proposed forecasting model which combines with data mining techniques and neural network algorithm is based on the monitoring data of air pollution obtained from Shijiazhuang air quality monitoring stations.

## How to run

### Local

- Install Python 3 and a suitable IDE like PyCharm
- Download the 2019-05-19.csv dataset and AirQuality_Prediction.ipynb
- Install packages - Numpy, Pandas, torchvision, Seaborn, Tensorflow, Matplotlib, Sklearn, math
- Open the AirQuality_Prediction.ipynb notebook in the IDE, and run the cells sequentially, or click 'Run All'
